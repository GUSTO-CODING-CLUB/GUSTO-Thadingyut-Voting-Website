# Firebase Authentication Setup Guide

## 🔥 Firebase Integration Complete!

Your voting website now has Firebase authentication integrated with your Flask backend. Here's what's been implemented:

### ✅ What's Working:
1. **Firebase Authentication** - Users can login with Google or email/password
2. **Flask Backend Integration** - Firebase tokens are verified on the server
3. **Protected Routes** - All voting pages require authentication
4. **Session Management** - User info is stored in Flask sessions
5. **Professional UI** - Beautiful login page with your branding

### 🚀 Setup Instructions:

#### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### 2. Download Firebase Service Account Key
1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Select your project: `coding-c282b`
3. Go to Project Settings → Service Accounts
4. Click "Generate new private key"
5. Download the JSON file
6. Rename it to `firebase-service-account.json`
7. Place it in your project root directory

#### 3. Set Environment Variables
Add to your `.env` file:
```
SECRET_KEY=your-super-secret-key-here
```

#### 4. Run Your Application
```bash
python app.py
```

### 🎯 How It Works:

1. **Login Flow:**
   - User visits `/login` (now the entry point)
   - Authenticates with Firebase (Google or email/password)
   - Firebase token is sent to Flask backend
   - Backend verifies token and creates session
   - User is redirected to home page

2. **Protected Routes:**
   - All voting-related pages require authentication
   - Unauthenticated users are redirected to login
   - User info is displayed on the home page

3. **Logout:**
   - Users can logout via the navigation menu
   - Session is cleared and user is redirected to login

### 🔧 Routes Added:
- `/login` - Login page (entry point)
- `/auth` - Authentication endpoint (POST)
- `/logout` - Logout endpoint

### 🛡️ Protected Routes:
- `/` (Home)
- `/candidates` (Voting page)
- `/viewmore` (Candidate details)
- `/vote` (Vote submission)

### 🎨 Features:
- **Google Sign-In** with one-click authentication
- **Email/Password** registration and login
- **Email verification** required for new accounts
- **Professional message boxes** for feedback
- **User welcome message** on home page
- **Responsive design** for all devices

### 🚨 Important Notes:
1. Make sure `firebase-service-account.json` is in your project root
2. Never commit the service account key to version control
3. The login page is now your website's entry point
4. All voting functionality requires authentication

Your voting website is now secure and professional! 🎉
